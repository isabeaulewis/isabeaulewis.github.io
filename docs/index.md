Welcome! I'm Isabeau Lewis, an evolutionary ecologist interested in plant sexual diversity, with a particular focus on how reproduction varies spatially and temporally.

I completed my undergraduate degree in [Biology at Queen's University](https://biology.queensu.ca/) in 2023, where I was supervised by [Dr. Jannice Friedman](https://jfriedmanlab.wordpress.com/). My research focused on 1) the evolution of kin discrimination in plants and 2) floral advertisement and sex responses to variable pollinator visitation. You can learn more about this work [here](https://isabeaulewis.github.io/research).

Find me also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/isabeau_lewis) and [Github](https://github.com/isabeaulewis)!
