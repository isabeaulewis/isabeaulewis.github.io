Our world exhibits extraordinary (and beautiful!) natural variation. I aim to understand the evolutionary forces shaping this diversity, and its ecological outcomes, with a focus on plant reproduction. How does plant sexual diversity shift spatially and temporally?
<br>

My research so far has examined 1) the evolution of kin discrimination in plants and 2) floral plasticity in response to variable pollinator visitation. You can learn more about each of these projects below.

### 1. Kin discrimination in _Mimulus guttatus_

### 2. Floral plasticity in _Saponaria officinalis_
