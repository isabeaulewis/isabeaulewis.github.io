**RESEARCH INTERESTS**
>I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in the forces promoting and constraining the persistence of plant species in space and time. I am particularly drawn to sexual system transitions, trade-offs, and plasticity.

**RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**
> **Field Team Leader** (Queen's University, July 2023)
> > I supervised an ongoing project on floral advertisement and sex allocation.
> 
> **BIOL537 Honours Thesis Project - National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Undergraduate Student Research Award** (Queen’s University, May 2022 – August 2023)
> > I investigated responses in floral advertisement and sex allocation to variable pollinator visitation in a common garden. I designed and conducted a follow-up study in summer 2023.
> 
> **BIOL538 Independent Research Project** (Queen’s University, January 2021 – April 2021)
> > I investigated responses in vegetative and generative growth to neighbour relatedness in a greenhouse experiment.
>
> **Field & Greenhouse Research Technician** (Queen’s University, September 2021 - August 2023)
>> I assisted on projects investigating a) the heritability of clonality; b) the evolution of wind pollination; c) intra- and inter-year resource allocation under pollinator limitation; d) phenotypic variation between a species’ native- and non-native ranges.
